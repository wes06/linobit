# Linobit
## A recreational core rope ROM device


### Descripci√≥n:
Linobyte is a core rope memory experiment. It has the goal of teaching basic electronics and programing concepts such as bits and bytes through the construction of an obsolete type of memory.

### Dirigido a:
Makers, beginners and hardware enthusiasts interested in hardware production, media archeology, PCB assembly, Arduino, electronics, etc. 

Soldering, electronics and programming knowledge are not required, however it is important that the participant has decent manual dexterity if she/he wants to build Linobit him/herself. Otherwise I can help with the process.

### Objetivos:
Linobyte has two main objectives: 
1 - introduce basic computation and electronics concepts through a hands on process
2 - introduce the process of assembly of electronics - from bill of materials, components and blank PCB to uploading the firmware. As a lot of the processes depend a lot on technique, being able to do it in a workshop with an instructor is a lot better than trying to do it alone without the proper techniques and tools. So a large part of the goal is to "break the ice" and make building hardware less intimidating, especially when it comes to SMD components.

Wesley Lee

Designer, self-taught in electronics, has years of experience designing and building experiments and experiences such as installations, objects, wearables for artists, brands, educational and industrial applications. Some examples include permanent installations at Google Brazil headquarters and FLAG.CX, his yearly Hardware and Design mentorship at Red Bull Basements Hacker residency, and consultancy services for brazilian mining (Vale S.A.) and sugar industries.

His most recent project, Linobyte, is a mix of media archeology, educational kit and hardware fabrication experiment. It has been featured at Ars Electronica 2018 (Linz, Austria), Push 2018 (Munich, Germany), BestOFF 2018 (Linz, Austria) and TADAEX 2018 (Tehran, Iran).

Due to linobyte's reception, a demand for a more shareable version was created. Hence Linobit was born, a workshop-buildable version of Linobyte.







Necessary tools from Hangar / TMTMTM - Soldering stations and Hot air stations
